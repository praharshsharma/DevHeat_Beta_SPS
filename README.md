# Problem Statement
Kamrej Calling 

# Introduction
This is our project for submission in a 7-day long Hackathon Devheat-Beta organised by GDSC IIIT SURAT.
We have made a platform which allows the user to generate bill for the food ordered in the restuarant. It also give a feature to create individual bills thus making them free of the tedious task of keeping track of everyone's bill amount.

# Frontend

 - HTML<br>
 - CSS<br>
 - Javascript<br><br>

# Project Description

- We have created a website to generate bills with GST calculation included. It asks the user which type of bill he/she wants to generate.<br>
- We have two types of bills. First one gives the per-head amount of the total bill and the second one generates individual bill for each customer for the particular dishes they have ordered.<br>
- The effective CSS used in the website makes it well designed and gives an organised user friendly interface.<br>
- It allows the users to select their desired dishes in just one click as each dish in the menu has its own button.<br>
- The website stores data in an effective way which hence generates the bill in systematic manner for each individual.<br>
- We have used JavaScript's local storage to store the user inputs. Every button has its own javascript function which access the value(rate) of each button(food item) and adds it to the local storage.<br>
- As we click on generate bill button, javascipt code fetches the data from the local storage and performs the calculations as specified.<br>
- It then changes the inner html of the page and prints the bill in tabular format.
